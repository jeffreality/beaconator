beaconator
==========

iOS app for testing iBeacon functionality

===

The Beaconator is a utility for use in testing iBeacon apps. 

Set the values to what you need, and then use it to broadcast. You can then test your apps to make sure they receive the info that you want, as needed. This app is also helpful when recruiting large numbers of people to do a large scale test.

For example, I was testing a new app that will need to react when it "hears" certain beacons broadcasting. I used the Beaconator on other devices, set up to broadcast different major and minor values, and then I walked around the office and tested entering and exiting different beacon zones.
